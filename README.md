# CENG 305 Object Oriented Programming with Java
I will share my codes for assignments from the CENG305 course in this repo.

## Course Objectives
The course introduces the Object-Oriented concepts using Java as a programming language. The course allows the students to develop their programming skills in Object Oriented enviorement. The students will learn how to develope a valid, well structured, efficient, maintainable solution to a real life problem. Hence, they will learn how to develop and write the well-documented classes in Java

## Course Content
Object Oriented Programming concepts ,classes and objects, using constructors and set-get methods, method overloading ,inheritance and polymorphism, java language elements.

##Course Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. interpret basic parts of a class definition including attributes, constructors and methods.

2. create an object using its class definition.

3. understand that access modifiers (private, public, etc. ) provide encapsulation.

4. compile and interpret Java source code from command line.

5. input data from command line.

6. interpret wrapper classes and their purpose.

7. illustrate how UML diagrams show the relations between classes.

8. make use of fields and the methods of pre-defined API classes.

9. develop visual applications using swing classes.

10. interpret how inheritance is constructed between classes.

11. illustrate how to override a parent class method in the child class.

12. apply overloading of methods in a class.

13. explain the importance of exception handling and they will able to write their own exception classes.
